# Rollup Plugin Image Import Optimize
This is a [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) plugin to support importing of images, similar to
what [@rollup/plugin-image](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/image) does.

However, this plugin does not import the image into your bundle. Instead, your image is emitted as asset and
your import is an object containing URLs to your image in different file formats:
```js
import {webp, png} from './picture.svg';

document.write(`<img src="${webp}" />`);
document.write(`<img src="${png}" />`);
```

Optimization of images can be configured. The plugin uses [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) internally
to process images.
